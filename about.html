                    <p>
                        If you want to know more about me, read on.<br>
                        I have ever since my early teens been interested in computers and technology. When I was 12
                        years old, I got my first computer, an Commodore Amiga 500.<br>
                        By that time, all my time in front of the computer was spent on playing games, but as the years
                        went by, I got more and more curious about how the computer worked and how software was made.
                        When I began at the gymnasium (high school) I chose to study electronics, with focus on
                        computers. I got to know more about a computer's hardware, but I also got my first
                        contact with programming.<br>
                        During this time, programming languages like BASIC, Pascal and Assembler were popular, and I
                        learned the basics of coding in these languages. This was also the time when Internet became
                        more popular and became every man's property.<br>
                        Everybody was buying a modem and started
                        subscriptions with ISP's, and so did I. This was how I found interest for HTML and it didn't
                        take long until I created my first simple website.</p>
                    <p>
                        After high school I was participating in an EU project so I was living in London, England for 
                        a year.<br>
                        After returning to Sweden, I started a new course learning computer networking and worked much
                        with Windows NT Server and later Windows 2000.<br>
                        Unfortately the market for network administrators was filled by the time I was finished and I 
                        had to work with other stuff that was far away from computers for a long time.</p>
                    <p>
                        During this time my family life started so with a wife and two kids I didn't have much time to
                        focus on my interest for computers and programming.<br>
                        However, now when my oldest son has become a teenager he has shown the same interest for
                        computers as I had when I was young, so now I have the opportunity to share my interest with 
                        him and this also has made me come back to my passion for coding.
                        So the latest year I have been studying programming on my own, primary in Python but also the
                        basics in all three C lanuguages (C, C# and C++).<br>
                        Not long after this I felt an urge that this is what I want to work with, and I also found out 
                        that there was a need for fullstack web developers.
                        So I started to learn web development, both frontend and backend.<br>
                        Everything I have learned this far has fallen naturally easy for me and I have enjoyed every
                        minute of it.<br>
                        As a Python programmer and a fullstack web developer I feel that I have found my calling in life
                        and I am excited to see where this journey will take me.<br>
                        I am eager to start work with this professionally and I am open for any opportunities that may
                        come my way.</p>
